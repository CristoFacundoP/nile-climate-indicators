# nile-climate-indicators
This repository supports Chapter 2 (Jul 2025‚ÄìJan 2026) of my PhD research, focusing on climate change and potential impacts across the Nile Basin.

The project includes:

Data processing: Downloading, screening, and bias-correcting CMIP6 GCMs.

Indicator computation: Calculating IPCC-recommended climate impact-driver indicators (heat, wet, dry).

Model assessment: Evaluating GCM skill and ranking using statistical tests.

Trend analysis: Detecting mid- and late-century climate trends.

Visualization & tools: Scripts and notebooks for bivariate plots, spatial analysis, and hotspot detection.

üìÇ The repo is organized into folders for data, scripts, results, docs, and notebooks.
‚öôÔ∏è All workflows are designed for reproducibility on both local machines and the Alliance Fir cluster.
